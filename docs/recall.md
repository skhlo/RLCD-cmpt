# Recall System

The recall system provides searchable session history after compaction. Pi's default compaction discards old messages; blackhole preserves them through a unified `recall` tool and `/blackhole-recall` command.

## recall tool

The agent gets a unified `recall` tool registered via [[src/tools/recall.ts]]. It handles five input types:

### Entry expansion (#N)

Expands a session entry by index to show full content (not truncated). Parsed by `VCC_ENTRY_PATTERN` (`/^#(\d+)$/`).

Calls `vccRecall({ query: "", expand: [index] })`, merges expanded entries into results (appends non-overlapping, replaces overlapping). Invalid indices outside available range are reported via `invalidExpandIndices()`.

### Drill-down (#N:path / #N:text)

Explores file content from a tool call within a specific entry, or a message body. Parsed by [[src/core/drill-down.ts]].

Pattern: `#(\d+):(.+?)(?::(full|\d+(?::\d+)?))?$`

| Syntax | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `#42:auth.ts` | File preview, first 30 lines |
| `#42:auth.ts:full` | All file content (50KB cap) |
| `#42:auth.ts:30` | Lines 31-60 (offset 30, default limit 30) |
| `#42:auth.ts:30:20` | Lines 31-50 (offset 30, limit 20) |
| `#42:file` | List all files, or auto-select if single |
| `#42:text` | Message-body preview (first 30 lines) |
| `#42:text:full` | Full message body (50KB cap) |
| `#42:text:30` / `#42:text:30:20` | Message-body windows |

Reads raw session JSONL via `loadAllMessages()`, finds content-bearing tool calls via `isContentBearing()`, matches path via `tc.path.includes(pathPattern)`. Formats edits as `--- edit N ---\noldText\n--- becomes ---\nnewText`. The `#N:text` form covers user/assistant/toolResult text plus bashExecution command+output, so budget-clipped expanded entries can be paged in full.

### Response budget

Every recall response is capped at `recallResponseMaxChars` (default 48,000 characters ≈ 12k tokens, `0` = unbounded). Implemented in [[src/core/recall-budget.ts]] and threaded through [[src/tools/recall.ts]]:

- **Search snippet lines** are capped (~1000 chars) with the match kept visible, so one huge tool-result line cannot flood a page.
- **Expanded entries** share the budget (`expandAllocation()`); each carries a continuation marker to `#N:text:full` / `#N:path:full` for the full payload.
- **Related observation/reflection bodies** are capped (~1200 chars); full content stays reachable via the 12-hex memory id.
- **Total budget** (`capRecallBlocks()`) is enforced entry-aware: trailing entries drop before the header, and a footer names the omitted count and continuation affordance (`page:N` / `expand:[N]` / `#N:text` / `#N:path`).

The knob is `recallResponseMaxChars` (env `PI_BLACKHOLE_RECALL_RESPONSE_MAX_CHARS`); per-entry and per-line shares are derived from it internally.

### OM memory ID (12-char hex)

Recovers source evidence for a specific observation or reflection from the session ledger. Parsed by `MEMORY_ID_PATTERN` (`/^[a-f0-9]{12}$/`).

Calls `omRecall(id)` → `recallMemorySources()` from [[src/om/ledger/recall.ts]]. Shows observations (with `[dropped]` marker for tombstoned ones), reflections, and source entries. Annotates sources with `#N` indices via `buildIndexMap()` + `formatEntryIndexAnnotation()`.

### Free text search (BM25)

BM25-ranked OR search across transcript text and/or file content. Rare terms weighted higher. Defined in [[src/core/search-entries.ts]].

#### BM25 algorithm

Constants: `BM25_K = 1.2`, `BM25_B = 0.75`. ~70 English stopwords filtered from queries.

```
IDF = log((N - df + 0.5) / (df + 0.5) + 1)
TF-Norm = (tf * (K + 1)) / (tf + K * (1 - B + B * dl / avgDl))
Score = sum(IDF * TF-Norm for each term)
```

Stopwords removed from query terms before scoring. Each term is classified individually: terms with regex operators (`/[|*+?{}()[\]\\^$]/`) stay patterns, plain terms — including dotted filenames (`observer.ts`) — match literally. A natural sentence mentioning a file therefore ranks via BM25 instead of compiling as one never-matching whole-query pattern.

#### Search modes

| Mode | Searches |
|------|----------|
| `hybrid` (default) | Transcript text + tool call args |
| `file` | Only tool call args (file content) |
| `touched` | Aggregate all files written/edited, grouped by path |

#### File indicators

`getFileIndicators()` counts lines per file in content-bearing tool calls. `computeFileMatches()` filters lines matching query regex with snippets (`±2` context lines). `getTouchedFiles()` aggregates entries per path for `mode:touched`.

### Scope

`scope:lineage` (default) searches only the active lineage. `scope:all` searches across all session lineages. Active lineage extracted via [[src/core/lineage.ts]] `getActiveLineageEntryIds()`.

### Pagination

`page:N` (1-based, default 5 results per page). Expand entries merged before pagination for consistent counts. Footer includes scope hint.

## Offline lexical baseline

The development-only [replay evaluator](replay-evaluator.md) runs this same query
planner, session loader, and lexical search against explicit synthetic fixtures.
It measures candidate coverage and lexical rank without changing either recall
surface. It performs no Jev call or runtime reranking.

## OM coupling

When expanding session entries (`#N`), the tool automatically looks up related observations and reflections from the session ledger. Defined in [[src/om/reverse-recall.ts]].

- `findObservationsForEntryIds()` — Finds observations whose `sourceEntryIds` intersect with the expanded entries
- `findReflectionsForEntryIds()` — Finds reflections that support those observations (via `supportingObservationIds`)
- Results annotated with `#N` indices via `buildIndexMap()` + `formatEntryIndexAnnotation()`

OM integration is wrapped in try/catch — branch may not be available in all contexts. Dropped observations included with `[dropped]` marker.

## /blackhole-recall command

User-facing command for interactive session history search. Defined in [[src/commands/vcc-recall.ts]]. Same engine as the `recall` tool.

The command renders to the TUI for the human operator, so it is intentionally not covered by the `recallResponseMaxChars` total budget (per-entry snippet/body clips still apply via the shared modules). Capping user-facing command output is a separate follow-up.

```
/blackhole-recall auth token                        # active-lineage search, ranked
/blackhole-recall auth token page:2                 # paginated (5 results/page)
/blackhole-recall hook|inject                       # regex
/blackhole-recall fail.*build scope:all             # regex across all lineages
/blackhole-recall mode:file                         # search only write/edit file content
/blackhole-recall mode:touched                      # aggregate view of all files touched
/blackhole-recall                                   # recent 25 entries
```

Results shown as a collapsible message and auto-fed to the agent as context. Calls `augmentWithObservations()` after rendering to append related OM observations/reflections.

## Session file access

All session access goes through `loadAllMessages()` in [[src/core/load-messages.ts]]. LRU cache:

- Max 3 entries
- 2-second TTL
- mtime-based invalidation (detects file changes between cache hits)
- Cache key includes `allowedEntryIds` set (sorted JSON for collision-free lineage filtering)
- Parse errors logged via `console.warn()` but don't throw

## Content indexing

Only full-file writes are indexed for text search. Tool args capped at 10KB per call.

### Content formatting

`formatRecallOutput()` in [[src/core/format-recall.ts]] formats search results:

- `shortPath()` — Shorten paths relative to CWD or show last 3 components
- `formatFileMatch()` — Tool name, path, line count, optional snippet
- `formatTouchedOutput()` — Paginated file-touch list (5 per page)
