# RLCD-cmpt

A design-stage fork of [pi-blackhole](https://github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole),
exploring Jev's RLCD-trained judgments for session-memory retrieval. Runtime
behavior remains upstream `v0.5.5`, with a type-only Pi peer-floor compatibility
correction. A deterministic offline lexical replay evaluator is available; the
Jev integration and runtime reranking are not implemented or installed.

Start with the [refined retrieval-first proposal](work_docs/proposals/retrieval-first-final.md)
and the [original proposals and runnable HTML prototypes](work_docs/proposals/README.md).
The upstream documentation below describes the existing Blackhole runtime, not
completed RLCD-cmpt features. The inherited package name remains `pi-blackhole`.

## Offline lexical replay evaluator

The credential-free evaluator runs the unchanged lexical recall planner, loader,
and search over explicit synthetic fixtures. It reports candidate coverage,
answer@5, mean reciprocal rank, candidate misses, rank misses, invalid truth, and
no-answer behavior without changing Pi runtime behavior.

```sh
pnpm --silent replay:lexical -- \
  --corpus fixtures/replay/public-v1/tuning/corpus.jsonl \
  --queries fixtures/replay/public-v1/tuning/queries.json \
  --truth fixtures/replay/public-v1/tuning/truth.json \
  --partition tuning
```

See [the evaluator documentation](docs/replay-evaluator.md) for fixture schemas,
partition isolation, frozen labeling rules, and reproducible manifests.

## Upstream pi-blackhole

**Deterministic compaction + session-aware observational memory for [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi) — in one unified extension.**

`/blackhole` replaces Pi's LLM-based `/compact` with an algorithmic structural summary — fast, zero-cost. Three background workers (Observer, Reflector, Dropper) capture durable facts and decisions that survive across compactions. Per-worker model fallback chains with persisted cooldowns. Manual flush mode. One JSON file to configure it all.

---

## Install

```bash
# From npm (recommended)
pi install npm:pi-blackhole

# Or directly from GitHub
pi install git:github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole
```

If you have standalone `pi-vcc` or `pi-observational-memory` installed, remove them first — they conflict and will prevent blackhole from loading:

```bash
pi uninstall npm / git:https://github.com/sting8k/pi-vcc
pi uninstall npm / git:https://github.com/elpapi42/pi-observational-memory
```

Then `/reload` or restart Pi. The config file at `~/.pi/agent/pi-blackhole/pi-blackhole-config.json` is created with sensible defaults — no setup required for the default behavior. Config merges global → project → env → session (session is ephemeral). See **[`docs/CONFIG.md`](docs/CONFIG.md)** for tuning or run `/blackhole settings` to open the interactive overlay.

> **Want a guided setup?** Pass [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) to your agent — it will walk you through the interview, including picking cheap fallback models for your providers.

## ✨ What's new

> **Latest release: [0.5.5](CHANGELOG.md)**
>
> - **Custom-provider memory workers fixed** — observer/reflector/dropper requests now carry Pi's session headers, so gateways that require them (OpenCode `MissingSessionID`) stop rejecting every worker call. ([#93](https://github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole/issues/93))
> - **Deterministic provider errors cool down into fallbacks** — bad credentials, unknown models, and other 4xx failures stop burning retries on the broken model and fall through to `*FallbackModels` instead.
> - **Skipped subagent compactions are now visible** — in-memory sessions disposed before deferred compaction now count (`Skipped compactions (disposed ctx)` in `/blackhole-memory` status) and warn once per session instead of failing silently. ([#92](https://github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole/issues/92))
> - **Mid-run compaction works on unbundled Pi installs** — per-root host discovery plus per-host helper binding, so the inline path no longer stays silently unavailable. ([#96](https://github.com/k0valik/pi-blackhole/issues/96))
> - **Minimum supported Pi is 0.84.3**, and the compat CI job now tracks the `peerDependencies` floor instead of a hardcoded version.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

## What it does

Long engineering sessions degrade. Pi's native `/compact` calls an LLM to write a free-form prose summary — then compacts that summary, then compacts the next. After a few cycles, load-bearing details vanish: why a decision was made, which approaches were rejected, what the user clarified early on. The session is still alive; the agent has stopped carrying the real context.

`pi-blackhole` solves this in two complementary ways:

- **Algorithmic compaction** — a deterministic, zero-cost `compile()` pipeline extracts structured sections (goal, files, commits, preferences, brief transcript) and replaces the old conversation with one compact block. No LLM is called for compaction itself.
- **Observational memory** — three background workers (Observer → Reflector → Dropper) run during the session, capturing timestamped facts and distilling durable reflections in a session ledger that survives every compaction.

Both halves share a single hook and a single output. Together they keep the agent's context sharp across arbitrarily long sessions — without the cost, drift, or erosion of repeated LLM-based summarization.

All commands work regardless of `compaction` mode — only _when_ auto-compaction fires changes. See [Compaction modes](#compaction-modes) below.

### The `recall` tool (agent-facing)

The agent gets one unified `recall` tool that handles every form of historical lookup. Searches read the raw session file directly, bypassing compaction.

| Input           | What it does                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[12-char hex]` | Recover source evidence for a specific observation or reflection ID from the session ledger.                                                                                         |
| `#N`            | Expand a session entry by index (show full content, bounded by the response budget).                                                                                                 |
| `#N:path`       | Drill-down into file content from a tool call (e.g. `#42:auth.ts` shows first 30 lines; `#42:auth.ts:30` shows the next 30; `#42:auth.ts:full` shows everything).                    |
| `#N:text`       | Drill-down into a message body (user/assistant/tool/bash text) with the same paging (`#42:text`, `#42:text:30`, `#42:text:full`) — the continuation path for budget-clipped entries. |
| Free text       | BM25-ranked search across transcript and/or file content. Rare terms weighted higher.                                                                                                |
| `mode:file`     | Search only write/edit file content.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `mode:touched`  | Aggregate all files written/edited across the session, grouped by path.                                                                                                              |
| Regex           | Pattern search (e.g. `fork.*pi-vcc`, `hook\|inject`).                                                                                                                                |
| `scope:all`     | Search across all session lineages (default: active lineage only).                                                                                                                   |

When the agent expands a session entry (`#N`), related observations and reflections from the session ledger are automatically shown alongside the expanded content — so the agent gets the raw transcript _and_ the durable fact layer in one call.

Every recall response is capped at `recallResponseMaxChars` (default 48,000 ≈ 12k tokens). Search snippet lines, expanded entries, and related observation bodies are clipped to keep a single huge stored message from flooding the context; a truncation marker names the omitted entries and how to continue (`#N:text` / `#N:path` / `page:N`).

The `/blackhole-recall` command exposes the same engine to the user. Results are shown as a collapsible message and auto-fed to the agent as context.

---

## Compaction modes

Two modes, one shared goal: keep your agent's context sharp without manual housekeeping. (`compaction: "off"` is a third escape hatch that hands everything back to Pi.)

|                             | Auto (default)                                                         | Manual (`compaction: "manual"`)                  | Off (`compaction: "off"`)                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workers run?                | Yes                                                                    | Yes                                              | Yes (unless `memory: false`)                               |
| Observations go to          | Conversation markers (invisible in TUI)                                | Per-session disk buffers                         | Conversation markers                                       |
| Auto-compact on `agent_end` | Yes — fires at the auto-compaction threshold (preset curve by default) | No                                               | No (Pi handles it)                                         |
| `/compact` (Pi built-in)    | Replaced by blackhole                                                  | Pi handles                                       | Pi handles                                                 |
| `/blackhole`                | Optional                                                               | **Required** to flush + compact                  | Optional, but works                                        |
| Use case                    | "Install and forget"                                                   | "I want to control when context gets compressed" | "Let Pi handle it, but I want `/blackhole` when I need it" |

Manual mode is the maintainer's daily driver: workers still run, but observations accumulate in `<sessionId>-pending.json` files instead of cluttering the conversation. `/blackhole` flushes the buffer, runs algorithmic compaction, and injects durable reflections in one shot.

`compaction: "off"` + `memory: false` (or `PI_BLACKHOLE_PASSIVE=true`) completely disables all background workers and blackhole's auto-compaction — useful for debugging or comparing against Pi's native path. Explicit `/blackhole` still works in this mode.

#### Who owns the compaction?

With the default `compactionEngine: "blackhole"`, blackhole's `session_before_compact` hook owns every compaction Pi initiates — threshold auto-compact, overflow recovery, and `/compact` — replacing Pi's LLM summarizer with the deterministic pipeline. The only exception is defensive: if both the VCC summary and the OM projection come up empty (a pathological all-noise transcript), blackhole declines and Pi's native summarizer runs, so you never get a context-free replacement. With `compactionEngine: "pi-default"`, `compaction: "manual"`, or `compaction: "off"`, Pi handles everything except explicit `/blackhole`. See [`docs/CONFIG.md` → `compactionEngine`](docs/CONFIG.md#compactionengine) for the full interaction matrix.

### How does `/blackhole` compare to `/compact`?

- `/compact` calls an LLM to write a free-form summary — costly, lossy, no memory layer.
- `/blackhole` uses algorithmic section extraction (goals, files, commits, preferences…) **plus** injects observations and reflections from the session ledger. No LLM is involved in the compaction itself. Fast, deterministic, memory-preserving - the observational memory pipeline's arrived results apply instantly on compaction.

`/blackhole` is essentially a single `/compact` that just works — especially in manual mode.

---

## How it works

When `/blackhole` fires (manually or via the auto-trigger), two things happen in one shot:

1. **The vcc pipeline** analyzes the transcript tail and produces a structured summary: session goal, file changes, commits, outstanding blockers, user preferences, and a rolling brief transcript. Deterministic — same input always produces the same output.
2. **Observational memory injection** renders accumulated observations and reflections from the session ledger and appends them below the summary.

The agent receives a deterministic recap of recent work _plus_ durable facts from the full session history — in a single replacement block. No LLM was called for the compaction itself.

---

## Quick start config

Defaults target ~128k context models and work out of the box — no tuning required. To keep costs low, set cheap models for the background workers (the only required change for most setups):

```json
{
  "observerModel": { "provider": "openrouter", "id": "qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct:free" },
  "reflectorModel": { "provider": "cerebras", "id": "gpt-oss-120b" },
  "dropperModel": { "provider": "cerebras", "id": "gpt-oss-120b" }
}
```

Fallbacks (optional): each worker tries `stageModel → stageFallbacks → base model → session model` (skipping cooled-down models). By default the workers **do not** fall back to your session model — this avoids surprise cost and cache busting. Enable it with `sessionFallback: true` (default) or set `model` as a shared fallback. See [`docs/CONFIG.md` → Model Configuration](docs/CONFIG.md#model-configuration).

Config file: **`~/.pi/agent/pi-blackhole/pi-blackhole-config.json`**

Full reference — every key, default, and env override — lives in:

## Demo

`/blackhole` collapses ~143k tokens of conversation into a ~6.3k structured summary (YMMV based on your settings). `/blackhole-memory` shows pipeline status. `/blackhole-recall` searches history — the agent can do the same via its `recall` tool.

### The three memory workers

Three background workers (separate LLM calls) run automatically during the session when `memory: true` (the default):

- **Observer** — reads conversation since the last observation marker and extracts timestamped facts: events, decisions, preferences. Input is capped to `observerChunkMaxTokens` newest-first to prevent context blowup on long sessions. Runs most frequently.
- **Reflector** — distills new observations into durable reflections: stable facts, patterns, and constraints that survive future compactions. Runs less often.
- **Dropper** — prunes low-value observations from active memory when the pool exceeds `observationsPoolMaxTokens`, while keeping reflections and other long-term elements safely in the session ledger.

```
[Conversation turn] ──> (accumulated tokens >= observeAfterTokens)
                            │
                            v
                    1. OBSERVER   (extracts timestamped observations)
                            │
                            v
                    2. REFLECTOR  (synthesizes durable reflections)
                            │
                            v
                    3. DROPPER    (prunes low-value observations)
```

Each worker uses an `agentLoop` with tool-calling capabilities — they don't just make a single LLM call. The observer, for example, can call `record_observations` multiple times per run to work through a chunk incrementally.

If any stage fails (model error, rate limit, timeout), remaining stages are skipped and the full pipeline retries on the next `agent_start` or `turn_end`. A 30-second retry gate prevents hammering failing APIs. Within each stage, the runtime tries all configured fallback models before giving up — each failed model is cooled down and skipped in subsequent attempts.

## What the agent sees after compaction

After compaction, the agent sees something like this (sections appear only when relevant — a session with no git commits won't show `[Commits]`):

```
[Session Goal]
- Fix the authentication bug in login flow
- [Scope change]
- Also update the session token refresh logic

[Files And Changes]
- Modified: src/auth/session.ts
- Created: tests/auth-refresh.test.ts

[Commits]
- a1b2c3d: fix(auth): refresh token after password reset

[Outstanding Context]
- lint check still failing on line 42

[User Preferences]
- Prefer Vietnamese responses
- Always run tests before committing

[user]
Fix the auth bug...

[assistant]
Root cause is a missing token refresh...
...transcript continues...

## Migration from an older version

If you're upgrading from a pre-0.4.0 config (the old `pi-vcc` / `pi-observational-memory` keys, or an early `pi-blackhole` config with `overrideDefaultCompaction` / `noAutoCompact` / `passive`): see **[`docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md`](docs/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)** for the key mapping, semantic changes, and notes on automatic migration.

The short version: old keys are auto-migrated in memory at load time and the on-disk file is never mutated. Set the new keys explicitly via `/blackhole settings` (alias `/blackhole configure`) to silence the migration notification.

The legacy config surface is documented at **[`docs/OLD_CONFIG.md`](docs/OLD_CONFIG.md)** for reference only — no new keys are added there.

## Credits

`pi-blackhole` started as a merge of two upstream projects but has since diverged significantly. The codebase still carries DNA from both:

- **[pi-vcc](https://github.com/sting8k/pi-vcc)** by @sting8k — algorithmic conversation compaction (the `compile()` pipeline, section extraction, recall core).
- **[pi-observational-memory](https://github.com/elpapi42/pi-observational-memory)** by @elpapi42 — session-ledger-based observation/reflection capture, memory agents, ledger folding.

What blackhole adds and reworks on top:

- **Unified configuration** — one JSON file, not two.
- **Per-worker model fallback chains** with persisted cooldowns that survive Pi restarts.
- **Manual flush mode** — `compaction: "manual"` saves observations to per-session disk buffers.
- **Conflict resolution** — OM hooks into vcc's compaction, not Pi's default.
- **Memory toggle** (`/blackhole om-off` / `/blackhole om-on`) — disable the memory layer without uninstalling.
- **Per-session pending state** — isolated per-session JSON files, no cross-session contamination.
- **Custom provider bridge** — consolidation agents loaded via jiti can still use provider stream functions registered by other extensions.
- **Retryable error detection with per-model cooldowns** — models that fail get cooled down, fallbacks tried automatically, 30-second retry gate prevents spam.
- **Improved observer/reflector/dropper prompts** — each heavily customized with detailed extraction rules, relevance guidance, and error handling.
- **OM-recall coupling** — when expanding session entries via `recall`, related observations and reflections are automatically shown.
- **Thinking level support** — per-model `thinking` field for reasoning effort control, including `max` where supported by the provider.
